# Automatically solve Celtix puzzles

Why would you want to do that? Are you trying to cheat your friends? Or do
you want to spoil the puzzle for yourself?

[Celtix](https://www.andrewt.net/puzzles/celtix/?p=3) is a fun new puzzle
by [Andrew Taylor](https://www.andrewt.net/).

I've been wanting to learn to use OpenCV and Python MIP for a while, so
here we go.

## Usage instructions

Take a screenshot, or use the one in the examples directory.

Run the solver:

    python3 main.py examples/board_screenshot.png

Wait for 1-10 minutes so it finds a solution.

And then view the results:

    display output.png
